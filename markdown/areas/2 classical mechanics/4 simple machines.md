# Simple Machines

There are many simple mechanisms that are useful for optimizing the amount of force you need to input into the tool for a better amount of force as an output. There are 6 main ones that are commonly taught.

## The inclined plane

The inclined plane is a simple method of raising a heavy object vertically using less input force. Instead of raising it straight up, you roll it up a slope.

Assuming that there is no drag force, the force required to push it at any moment is as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
F_{in} &\ge mg*\sin\theta \\
s_x &= \frac{s_y}{\tan\theta}
\end{align}
$$
Where $F_{in}$ is the input horizontal force, and $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the distance you need to push the object in $x$ and $y$.

## The wheel and axle



## The pulley

## The lever

The lever is a way of multiplying force by sacrificing distance. It consists of a long plane separated into 2 pieces by a *fulcrum*. If the 2 *arms* of the lever are different lengths, the ratio of input force to output force changes. The force follows the equations:
$$
\begin{align}
F_{out}*L_{out} &= F_{in}*L_{in} \\
\frac{D_{out}}{L_{out}} &= \frac{D_{in}}{L_{in}}
\end{align}
$$
Where $F$ stands for force, $L$ stands for arm length, and $D$ stands for total distance traveled by the input and output points.

## The screw

A screw is just an inclined plane going around a shaft.

The equations go like this:
$$
\begin{align}
F_{out} &= F_{in}*\frac{r_{in}}{r_{out}}*\cos\theta
\end{align}
$$
Where $r$ is the radius of the shaft and the input head, and $\theta$ is the inclination of the thread.
