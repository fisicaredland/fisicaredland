# Forces

Newtonian forces are actions that act on a body to accelerate it.

## Newton's second law

Newton's second law states (in its most basic form), that "The net force on a particle is equal to the time rate of change of its linear momentum". This basically means the following:
$$
F = ma
$$
This means that, if you want to accelerate a body of mass $m$ at an acceleration $a$, you need a force of $F$ newtons.

## Newton's third law

Newton's third law states that "To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". This basically means that forces go both ways: If you apply a force on a body, the body applies the same force back on you, in the opposite direction. This also means that the above formula can be reworded: "If a body of mass $m$ applies a force $F$ on *another* body, the first body will be accelerated at an acceleration $a$".

## Net force

A body can have many forces applied on it at the same time. In this case, when you want to calculate what happens to the body, you need to use the *net force*: The sum of all forces applied on the object. Using vectors, if two forces are facing the same direction, their magnitudes add, and if they are facing opposite directions, their magnitudes subtract.

The net force is commonly represented $F_{net}$.

## Force of gravity

For most small-scale Newtonian physics problems, gravity is considered to be a constant force facing straight down with a magnitude of $|F_g| = mg$: The mass of the object times the acceleration due to gravity.

## Normal force

The *normal force* (commonly represented $F_N$) refers to the force that stops a body from going through the floor.

As Newton's first law states, a body with a net force of 0 must be stationary or have a constant velocity. Therefore, if you have an object on the ground, it must have a net force of 0; Therefore, the force of gravity, facing downwards, must be getting canceled by another force facing upwards: The normal force.

Whenever there is a body being pushed into a surface, there is a normal force pushing it away, tangential to the surface. This means, for instance, that if a body is on an angled surface, the normal force will not face straight up; It will be tangential to the surface.

## Friction force

Friction is a force that opposes the movement of a body along a surface. Whenever you push a heavy box, you feel the friction force fighting back.
$$
F_{fr} = \mu F_N
$$
Where $F_{fr}$ is the friction force, $F_n$ is the normal force, and $\mu$ is the *coefficient of friction*. The coefficient of friction is a dimensionless (no units of measurement) quantity that quantifies the roughness of the object, which increases friction. One important thing to note is that the friction coefficient is different if the object is at rest or in movement; Commonly, the friction coefficient for an object at rest is called the *static friction coefficient*, and the coefficient for a moving object is the *kinetic friction coefficient*.
