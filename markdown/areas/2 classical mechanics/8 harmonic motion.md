# Harmonic motion

The formal definition of simple harmonic motion states that in the system, the acceleration of the body must be directly proportional to its displacement. In other words, it is an oscillating system. It is important that in simple harmonic motion, the displacement path must be either a straight line or a section of a circumference, bounded by 2 extreme points.

A good example of simple harmonic motion is the pendulum.

We will define the position of the pendulum as $x$, the velocity of the pendulum as $v$, and the acceleration of the pendulum as $a$. These values will change over time ($t$).

Imagine our pendulum starts at rest at the position $x=-1$.

As soon as the pendulum is released, its position will begin getting closer to 0, while its velocity begins going up.

As the pendulum crosses the point $x=0$, it will have minimum displacement, maximum velocity, and minimum acceleration.

As the pendulum reaches the point $x=1$, it will have maximum position, minimum velocity, and maximum acceleration.

As you can see, these are all trigonometric functions. In simple harmonic motion, position, velocity, and acceleration can be described as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 \sin(\omega t) \\
v &= \omega x_0 \cos(\omega t) \\
a &= -\omega^2 x_0 \sin(\omega t)
\end{align}
$$
